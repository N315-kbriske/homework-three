## Purpose
- This assignment will help you understand how to inject small HTML files into your index.html page. You will also be implementing a new way to navigate using the URL instead of the href

## Task
- You will be creating a full-site with at least 5 pages and they must all have content with images and text. Try duplicating a site you like (I chose level.co)
- This must be a dynamic site, which means when I click on a link it injects the views into the page
- You must also navigate using the URL and not the href's in the a tag
- Make sure you are using the MVC model that we have been using all semester
- You can create any page and design that you like but you must have five pages and they must contain images and text. Lorem is fine to use
- Make sure your folder structure is organized and that you style this using scss

Enjoy!
